# GloomhavenC19
Gloomhaven for people under quarantine

## About

A pandemic couldn't stop our team from adventuring. I made a little app in Unity that allows us to continue to play using conference software & screensharing (like WebEx, Zoom, Hangouts...)

This project is very much tailored to our specific group, so to make it usable for your own group you'll have to:

* Add player pieces for any classes you use beside Scoundrel, Brute, Spellweaver & Tinkerer
* Add your group's classes to the BattleGoals GameObject in the BattleGoals scene
* Add your own scenarios (you can start by cloning one of the existing ones)

And also

* Gather each player's character board, cards, tokens etc together with some bless/curse cards and enhancement stickers, and drop it off on their doorstep (or ship it) 

## Additional Tools

* [Gloomhaven Helper](http://esotericsoftware.com/gloomhaven-helper) for tracking monster & player stats (and monster cards)
* [Gloomhaven Campaign Tracker](https://ninjalooter.de/gloomhaven/scenarios) for tracking campaign progress
